WINERY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING JAVAFX
-------------------------------------------------

Software used:

- Eclipse
- JavaFX
- Maven
- Hibernate
- MySQL

-------------------------------------------------
Using the system:
1) Import the pom.xml and do the build
2) Run with the following arguments:
(Run --module-path ‘\path\to\javafx-sdk-12.0.1\lib’ --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml)

3) On the main page you can log in if the user is already registered (Login), register if the user is not registered (Subscribe),
or log in using an employee code (Employee).
To speed up use, I have already entered some data:

Login
-> Username: ‘prova@prova.it’
-> Password: ‘test’

Employee
-> Code: ‘00287755’

4) On the subordinate pages, both customer and employee, there are on-screen instructions.
